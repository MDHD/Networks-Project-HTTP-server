		Here are the academic projects I have completed till date:

		</p>
		
		<ol>
		
			<li>

			<h4> Visiting Researcher, University of Waterloo </h4> <i> (under Prof. Joanne M. Atlee, summer 2014) </i> <br> <br>
			Worked on a semantically configurable translator from BSML (a family of extended state-machine modelling languages) to SMV (Symbolic Model Verifier)
			
			</li>

			<li>

			<h4> Monorail Simulation </h4> <i> (guided by Prof. Ashwin Gumaste, completed spring 2014) </i> <br> <br>
			Simulated the working of a small-scale monorail system in VHDL, using hardware elements to emulate acceleration, top speed, braking and emergency halting mechanisms.
			
			</li>

			<li>

			<h4> Traffic Light Control System </h4> <i> (guided by Prof. Ashwin Gumaste, completed spring 2014) </i> <br> <br>
			Created a state-machine-based system in VHDL to control traffic lights at a busy city street intersection, to minimize cumulative waiting time and avoid dangerous simultaneous traffic routes.
			
			</li>

			<li>

			<h4> Escalator Simulation </h4> <i> (guided by Prof. Parag Chaudhuri, completed spring 2014) </i> <br> <br>
			A simulation of an escalator, implemented in popular two-dimensional physics engine Box2D.
			
			</li>

			<li>
			
			<h4> Ray-Tracer </h4> <i> (guided by Prof. Amitabha A Sanyal, completed spring 2013) </i> <br> <br>
			A powerful fully-featured ray-tracer for rendering multiple objects and light sources in 3D including features like object composition, depth of field, anti-aliasing, specular highlights, transparency and diffuse reflections and shadows, implemented in MIT-Scheme using the built-in graphics package. Done for a course on functional programming. <br>
			Details on the project can be found <a href="raytrcr.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

			</li>
			
			<li>
			
			<h4> Two-player Chess </h4> <i> (guided by Prof. Abhiram G Ranade, completed autumn 2012) </i> <br> <br>
			A simple, attractive and user-friendly implementation of two-player chess in C++, using a graphics library called simplecpp , done for an introductory computer programming course.

			</li>
			
			<li>
			
			<h4> Modeling cash flow in ATM's </h4> <i> (guided by Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan, completed in spring 2013) </i> <br> <br>
			Done for a statistics course. Modeled cash withdrawal from multiple ATM's in a city, taking into account factors like population and social status. Used time-dependent distribution functions to model variation in cash flow with time of day, and predicted efficient ATM-refill schedules.
