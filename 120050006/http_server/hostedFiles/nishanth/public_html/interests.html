		My academic interests include Computer Science, Mathematics, Psychology, and Philosophy. <br> <br>
		Most of my free time is spent playing video games on my PlayStation3. <br> <br>
		I enjoy listening to music, mostly guitar-driven rock. <br>
		My favourite song is <i>Voodoo Child (Slight Return)</i> by The Jimi Hendrix Experience. <br> <br>
		I have also been learning to play the guitar myself for over two years now, although with extremely limited success. <br> <br>
		I'm a fairly avid football fan (<i>Hala Madrid!</i>). <br> <br>
		I'm also extremely interested in English poetry, and have been reading and writing since I was a kid. <br>
		My favorite poem is <a
